# Mothball
Moth Project 7: A looping portal dodgeball game, our submission for the [GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025).

The theme for this Game Jam was 'Loop' and we implemented it in this game by having the dodgeball loop through portals on each side of the arena, only balls that have looped at least once can score.
